            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2024, PixelPerfect Pro was created to solve a simple problem: most online image and PDF editors require uploading files to servers, compromising user privacy and security.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We believe that editing tools should work 100% in your browser, keeping your files private and secure. Our tools will always be free, with no watermarks, no limits, and no data collection.</p>
            
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>All our tools use client-side JavaScript libraries to process your files directly in your browser. Nothing is uploaded to our servers. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your files never leave your device</li>
                <li>No data is collected or stored</li>
                <li>Works offline after first load</li>
                <li>No account or signup required</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>We're a small team of developers and designers passionate about creating tools that respect user privacy while providing professional-grade functionality.</p>
            
            <h2>Support Us</h2>
